# Twitch Plays Artifact

Allowed twitch users to type commands in stream chat to control a game of [Artifact](https://store.steampowered.com/app/583950/Artifact/). They even managed to beat the AI sometimes!

## Videos

As a side note, the stream ran during the glorious days of the [Artifact Twitch Raids](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/events/artifact-twitch-raids). Certain creative decisions have been made for the sake of people's entertainment and for a higher level of thumbnail clickbait.
